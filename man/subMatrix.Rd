\title{Subset a matrix with a subtree}
\usage{
subMatrix(tree_tibble, m, node = NA, simplify.names = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_tibble}{A tree in the \code{tbl_tree} class of the \emph{tidytree} package.}

\item{m}{A matrix, typically the output of \code{\link[=makeMatrix]{makeMatrix()}}.}

\item{node}{The ID number of the node to base the subtree.}

\item{simplify.names}{Reduce the genus name to a single letter.}
}
\value{
A subset of the \code{m} matrix.
}
\description{
Given a matrix of values where the rows and column names are species names
that are labels in a tree, subset that matrix to the species that are
present in the subtree starting at a given node.
}
\examples{
subMatrix(Halo_Tree, Halo_PercentDiff, simpl = TRUE)
subMatrix(Halo_Tree, Halo_PercentDiff, 9)
subTree(Halo_Tree, 9) |> subMatrix(Halo_PercentDiff)
