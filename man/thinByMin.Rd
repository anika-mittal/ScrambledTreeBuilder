\title{Thin a matrix by a minimum pairwise distance}
\usage{
thinByMin(D, min_dist)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{A square distance matrix (numeric) with identical row/column names.}

\item{min_dist}{Numeric scalar: minimum allowed pairwise distance.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix: the \strong{thinned distance matrix} restricted
to the kept labels (rows/columns in the order they were added).
}
\description{
Greedily select labels so that all pairwise distances among the kept labels
are >= \code{min_dist}
}
\examples{
D <- matrix(c(
  0, 3, 8, 6,
  3, 0, 7, 4,
  8, 7, 0, 5,
  6, 4, 5, 0
), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE,
dimnames = list(LETTERS[1:4], LETTERS[1:4]))
thin_by_min_distance_matrix(D, min_dist = 6)
